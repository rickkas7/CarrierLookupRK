# CarrierLookupRK

Library to look up country codes (MCC) and carrier names (MCC-MNC) from Particle device firmware.

This library uses a table stored in code flash space and uses about 30K of flash space (out of 128K) so it's probably more appropriate for debugging tools.

The two functions implemented are:

```
String lookupCountry(uint16_t mcc);
String lookupMccMnc(uint16_t mcc, uint16_t mnc);
```

## Generating New Data

The tool works by taking the mccmnc.json file that's generated by the [TowerInfo Tool](https://github.com/rickkas7/TowerInfo) and packing the data into significantly smaller C structures. The tool is in generator-tool and is run by doing:

```
cd generator-tool
node app.js
```

This generates the Carriers.h file from mccmnc.json.
